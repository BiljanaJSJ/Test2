# Topics covered

In this series, we introduce computational reproducibility and its importance to modern research. We will teach the general principles for reproducible computer-based analyses, along with specific methods and tools for reproducibility with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). We will also introduce version control with [GitHub](https://github.com/), which is an essential tool in a team environment.

You will learn how to:

* Construct reproducible, automatable workflows in R
* Create reproducible documents using Rmarkdown to include underlying code / computations with relevant graphical and statistical results in several different formats (reports, presentation slides, handouts, notes)
* Use Git version control
* Integrate version control with GitHub for both personal and group projects



# Setup Instructions

Please come to the workshop with your laptop set up with the required
software and data files. Follow the [instructions](setup.html) and
test the installed software that it works, as demonstrated in the
notes.
